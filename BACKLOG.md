## Next Action

### TASK-032 — Synthetic SQLite timestamp parse-evidence foundation

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_preflight_timestamp_parse_evidence_foundation`
- **Phase:** 2 — Reliable Market Data Platform
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** READY
- **Goal:** Add an unused pure interpretation layer that converts exact TASK-031 timestamp-cell
  byte evidence into deterministic typed parse outcomes while preserving the original bytes,
  storage class, row key, fingerprint, and snapshot linkage unchanged.
- **Scope:** Add strict frozen versioned parse-plan and parse-evidence contracts for the same 37
  direct timestamp columns. Register legacy ISO-8601 text or signed epoch-microsecond
  representation plus nullability per target. Consume only a valid TASK-031 extraction result and
  produce one typed outcome per input cell for parsed aware text, declared absence, naive text,
  malformed UTF-8 or timestamp text, out-of-range epoch values, and unexpected storage classes.
  Preserve original offset and spelling; do not normalize or emit replacement bytes.
- **Constraints:** Pure evidence consumption only: no SQLite connection, filesystem/path access,
  adapter invocation, schema inspection, or row query. Do not parse JSON containers. Do not
  normalize timestamps, compare projection agreement, analyze collisions, quarantine data, write
  a report or manifest, inspect operator or discovered data, or add CLI, service, provider,
  migration, repair, credential, signal, portfolio, Risk, order, financial, or active runtime
  wiring. Do not claim Stage 3 completion.

Acceptance gates:

1. Strict frozen plans and evidence reject unknown, duplicate, missing, unsupported, altered, or
   incorrectly linked declarations and input evidence.
2. Parsing accepts only one exact successful TASK-031 result and performs no SQLite or filesystem
   operation.
3. Text uses strict UTF-8 plus a frozen writer-compatible grammar; epoch evidence requires SQLite
   `INTEGER`, canonical decimal cast bytes, and an explicit supported range. Distinct malformed,
   naive, absent, overflow, and unexpected-storage outcomes remain typed.
4. Generated evidence covers all 37 columns plus fixed UTC, positive/negative offsets, legacy
   precision variants, calendar limits, malformed UTF-8/text, NULL, INTEGER, REAL, TEXT, BLOB,
   and epoch underflow/overflow.
5. Every input cell yields exactly one result in unchanged deterministic order, with row-key,
   storage-class, exact-byte, TASK-030, and TASK-031 evidence preserved.
6. No existing runtime path imports or calls the foundation, and relevant unit, integration,
   format, lint, type, lockfile, health-slice, dependency-audit, and CI gates pass.

## Recently Completed

### TASK-031 — Synthetic SQLite timestamp-byte evidence foundation

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_preflight_timestamp_evidence_foundation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** One pinned strict extraction plan per TASK-030 family now declares all 20 direct
  timestamp-bearing tables and 37 timestamp columns. The unused generated-fixture-only inspector
  fingerprints and extracts through the same immutable connection and exact whole-file snapshot,
  fails before row access unless exactly one expected family matches, and temporarily authorizes
  only each declared stable key and timestamp target. Bounded deterministic evidence preserves
  SQLite `typeof`, exact `hex(CAST(column AS BLOB))`, byte length, row-key bytes, and snapshot
  linkage without materializing a raw timestamp value. Tests cover all layouts, NULL, INTEGER,
  REAL, TEXT, BLOB, malformed text bytes, ordering, bounds, oversized cells, mismatches,
  wrong-family and ambiguity rejection, and unchanged source/directory evidence. No operator
  database, parser, report, manifest, runtime consumer, migration, or repair was added, and Stage
  3 remains incomplete.

### TASK-030 — Synthetic read-only SQLite preflight fingerprint foundation

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_preflight_fingerprint_foundation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** Strict frozen version-1 contracts now keep the expected family identity separate
  from observed evidence. A direct `mode=ro&immutable=1` inspector fingerprints encoding,
  application and user versions, exact typed marker bytes, normalized DDL, every schema object,
  tables, columns, foreign keys, explicit and implicit indexes, and triggers for all eight
  generated SQLite layouts. Exact pinned digests reject missing, extra, renamed, altered,
  spoofed, combined, wrong-family, or ambiguous layouts before timestamp rows can be read. Source
  hash, size, modification time, file identity, directory entries, and sidecar absence are
  reverified; an authorizer denies writes, temporary objects, `ATTACH`, and write pragmas. The
  foundation remains unused, scans no operator database or timestamp row, writes no report, and
  does not complete Stage 3.

### TASK-029 — Additive exact epoch-microsecond projection primitives

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_epoch_microsecond_primitives`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** The isolated canonical-UTC module now exposes exact signed bounds plus integer-only
  projection and inverse decoding between strict fixed-`datetime.UTC` values and Unix-epoch
  microseconds. Strict type and range handling rejects booleans, non-integers, and values outside
  Python's calendar; deterministic, property-style, and hostile-subclass tests prove exact
  negative/zero/positive landmarks, full-range round trips, one-microsecond distinction, and
  monotonic order. No runtime consumer, model, serialized byte, digest, identity, schema, query,
  projection, migration, or stored record changed.

### TASK-028 — Additive canonical UTC codec primitives

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_codec_primitives`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** One isolated pure module now provides strict fixed-`datetime.UTC` validation,
  explicit aware-input normalization, exact six-fractional-digit RFC 3339 `Z` serialization, and a
  strict canonical parser. Exhaustive deterministic and property-style tests cover offsets,
  named/rule-based zones, folds, calendar limits, malformed text, exact round trips, and hostile
  datetime subclasses. No existing runtime path imports or calls the helpers, and no model,
  serializer, digest, identity, schema, projection, query, or stored record changed.

### TASK-027 — Canonical UTC clock-boundary enforcement

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_clock_boundary_enforcement`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** One shared exact-`datetime.UTC` assertion now guards every direct injected-clock
  read in the scoped foundation, application, rate-budget, provider, and public-trade boundaries.
  Invalid initial values fail before IDs or downstream mutations; invalid later reads fail before
  the next side effect; provider and application error mappings remain typed. Persisted models,
  request acceptance, JSON, digests, keys, schemas, projections, and stored data are unchanged.

### TASK-026 — Canonical UTC boundary inventory and migration plan

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_boundary_inventory_and_migration_plan`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Decision:** `docs/decisions/0027-canonical-utc-boundary-and-migration-plan.md`
- **Result:** The repository now has an evidence-backed inventory of every discovered
  timestamp-bearing model, clock, provider edge, JSON/text boundary, SQLite projection, order,
  index, cursor, and test path. It selects Python datetimes in the fixed `datetime.UTC` zone, fixed
  microsecond-precision RFC 3339 `Z` text, and derived epoch-microsecond SQL projections as the
  target, with staged compatibility readers, preflight, quarantine, collision handling, digest
  versioning, backup, rollback, and migration verification. No runtime, schema, or data migration
  was performed.
- **Inventory:** `docs/CANONICAL_UTC_BOUNDARY_INVENTORY_AND_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

### TASK-025 — Typed public-trade transition-history reader

- **Key:** `phase2.public_trade_transition_history_reader`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Decision:** `docs/decisions/0026-typed-public-trade-transition-history.md`
- **Result:** The existing append-only SQLite transition ledger is now exposed through an
  immutable typed record and a read-only port with ascending contiguous checkpoint-version pages,
  an exclusive cursor, actor-authority and lifecycle validation, strict bounds, restart behavior,
  and fail-closed projection, canonical-record, continuity, and corruption checks. The existing
  schema is unchanged.

### TASK-024 — Public-trade checkpoint orchestrator

- **Key:** `phase2.public_trade_checkpoint_orchestrator`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Decision:** `docs/decisions/0025-bounded-public-trade-checkpoint-orchestration.md`
- **Result:** One explicitly invoked bounded application flow now composes the public-trade range
  collector, durable request budget, market-evidence admission, and restart-safe checkpoint
  control with policy validation, UUID fencing, evidence-first progress, typed outcomes, and
  injected UTC time.

## Queued, Not Yet Approved

- Design continuous public-trade collection only after typed transition audit access and
  operational recovery drills are accepted.

## Backlog Rules

- Only one item may be the canonical next action.
- A task must define goal, scope, constraints, acceptance evidence, and excluded work before code.
- Missing approval, policy, state, or critical evidence fails closed.
- Completing a task does not authorize deployment, mode promotion, private access, or trading.
