## Next Action

### TASK-050 — Fail-closed public-HTTP standard HTTPS target-port policy

- **Key:** `phase2.fail_closed_public_http_standard_https_target_port_policy`
- **Phase:** 2 — Reliable Market Data Platform
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** READY
- **Human approval:** NOT REQUIRED — bounded fail-closed development hardening under the owner's
  explicit authorization; it narrows public-network behavior and changes no permission,
  deployment, provider, or operator-data boundary.
- **Context:** TASK-049 now rejects structurally invalid or ambiguous initial targets, but it
  deliberately accepts every parsed explicit target port from 1 through 65,535. Every active
  provider default uses implicit HTTPS port 443. A different otherwise valid target port can
  select another TLS service even though the URL remains HTTPS; this policy concerns the caller's
  target authority only and does not constrain a configured proxy peer.
- **Goal:** Permit only an omitted target port or numeric target port 443 before query or request
  work, while preserving the exact original text of an accepted target.
- **Scope:** Extend the private initial-target validator after TASK-049 structural validation;
  reject a structurally valid explicit non-443 target port with exact
  `ValueError("url must use the standard HTTPS target port")`; and add deterministic no-work,
  precedence, preservation, and active-provider-default tests.
- **Files:** `src/wealth/adapters/http.py`, `tests/unit/test_http_adapter.py`,
  `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, plus coordinated governance files and governance tests.
- **Constraints:** Preserve TASK-049's structural error and precedence for malformed, encoded,
  empty, non-numeric, signed, Unicode-digit, zero, or out-of-range ports. Do not normalize,
  rewrite, resolve, or contact a rejected target. Do not add a provider or hostname allowlist, DNS
  lookup, IP or public-routability policy, SSRF guarantee, IDNA policy, certificate pinning, custom
  TLS context, proxy change, credential, redirect permission, retry, dependency, endpoint change,
  or provider-specific exception. Preserve accepted target text, sorted query construction,
  headers, timeouts, response caps, no-follow behavior, TASK-041 through TASK-049 exception and
  cleanup semantics, provider parsing, canonicalization, quality, storage, schemas, runtime
  wiring, TASK-037 authority, migration, and Stage 3.

Acceptance gates:

1. With a valid timeout and otherwise valid target, explicit ports 1, 80, 442, 444, and 65,535
   raise exactly `ValueError("url must use the standard HTTPS target port")`, with no direct or
   displayed parser cause. Malformed, percent-encoded, empty, non-numeric, signed, Unicode-digit,
   zero, and greater-than-65,535 ports retain TASK-049's exact structural error and precedence.
2. Every rejected non-443 target fails before the query mapping is accessed or serialized and
   before `Request`, the private opener, DNS, or any network or filesystem handler is invoked. No
   target is normalized, repaired, retried, or partially opened.
3. An implicit target port and explicit numeric port 443, including a zero-padded representation
   parsed as 443, retain their exact original URL text; the separately supplied sorted query is
   appended exactly once, and the existing GET method, `Accept`, `User-Agent`, and finite-positive
   timeout are forwarded unchanged.
4. Every active provider default URL remains unchanged and accepted. Non-redirect success,
   HTTP-error behavior, TASK-048 redirect rejection, and every TASK-041 through TASK-049 mapping,
   exclusion, direct cause, cleanup rule, and primary-failure precedence remain unchanged.
5. No provider or hostname allowlist, DNS lookup or resolution, IP/public-routability policy, SSRF
   guarantee, IDNA policy, certificate pin, TLS/proxy customization, endpoint, dependency, or
   provider-specific behavior is introduced. The policy constrains only the caller target port;
   a configured proxy may itself use a non-443 peer. Formatting, lint, strict typing, complete
   tests, lockfile verification, dependency audit, health slice, and CI pass.
6. TASK-037 remains blocked and authorization remains denied; no operator data, path, database,
   scanner, report, migration, or Stage 3 action occurs.

## Blocked, Awaiting Owner-Supplied Restricted Inputs

### TASK-037 — Operator-preflight authorization package and project-owner decision

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_preflight_operator_authorization_package_owner_decision`
- **Phase:** 2 — Reliable Market Data Platform
- **Risk tier:** RISK 3 — PRODUCTION AFFECTING (authorization decision only)
- **Status:** BLOCKED
- **Human approval:** REQUIRED — project owner plus independent Risk and Security review.
- **Blocking condition:** Owner-supplied exact restricted-package inputs are not available in a
  Security-approved governance location; independent Risk and Security reviews and the
  project-owner decision therefore remain unperformed. Authorization remains `DENIED`.
- **Resume condition:** Return TASK-037 to `READY` only after the exact required inputs are
  supplied through the approved restricted boundary; repository placeholders or TASK-038
  completion cannot satisfy this condition.
- **Preparation artifact:** The repository contains only the non-authorizing placeholder template
  at `docs/governance/TASK-037-operator-preflight-authorization-package.template.md`. It prohibits
  real deployment values and cannot satisfy any acceptance gate or approval requirement.
- **Goal:** Prepare the exact operator-preflight authorization package and obtain an explicit
  project-owner `APPROVE`, `REJECT`, or `REVISE` decision without accessing operator data.
- **Scope:** Record the proposed exact read-only database/path list and its real deployment
  cardinality, the writer-fenced consistent/immutable snapshot procedure, report destination,
  evidence retention/disposal boundary, and the change, environment, evidence, approver, UTC
  decision time, expiry or review trigger, monitoring, and tested rollback evidence required by
  policy.
- **Constraints:** Governance preparation and decision only. Do not inspect, resolve, check, or
  open any proposed operator path or database; access SQLite or operator data; scan rows; invoke
  an adapter; create an operational report or manifest; add serialization or scanner code; wire a
  runtime; migrate or repair data; alter a schema; or perform or claim Stage 3. Approved
  governance-artifact writes are the only filesystem mutation in scope. Do not store sensitive
  path metadata in an unapproved location. Missing, ambiguous, expired, conflicting, rejected, or
  revise-required authority remains denial.

Acceptance gates:

1. The package distinguishes the real proposed path-list cardinality from TASK-036's eight
   synthetic family-coverage slots and makes every exact family/path entry explicit.
2. The exact snapshot procedure is writer-fenced and SQLite-safe and specifies its consistency,
   immutability, and WAL/checkpoint handling without executing it.
3. The exact report destination and evidence retention/disposal boundary are identified through
   an approved handling location, with independent Risk and Security review recorded.
4. The decision identifies the change, scope, environment, evidence, project-owner approver, UTC
   decision time, expiry or review trigger, monitoring, tested rollback evidence, and one explicit
   `APPROVE`, `REJECT`, or `REVISE` outcome. Anything else fails closed.
5. No proposed operator path or database is inspected, resolved, checked, or opened; no SQLite or
   operator-data access, scan, adapter, operational report or manifest, serializer, scanner code,
   runtime action, migration, repair, schema change, or Stage 3 action occurs. Only approved
   governance-artifact writes are allowed.
6. Any approved scanner remains a separately scoped later task with its own risk review; no
   approval outcome automatically runs or authorizes code beyond its exact recorded scope, and
   all repository gates pass.

### TASK-049 — Fail-closed public-HTTP initial request-target validation

- **Key:** `phase2.fail_closed_public_http_initial_request_target_validation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Files:** `src/wealth/adapters/http.py`, `tests/unit/test_http_adapter.py`,
  `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, and the coordinated governance files and
  governance tests.
- **Result:** After finite-positive timeout validation and before any query-mapping operation, the
  shared client now validates the original initial target as an absolute credential-free HTTPS
  URL with a non-empty CPython-parser hostname. It rejects every literal `?`, `#`, or backslash;
  every C0 or DEL control, Unicode whitespace character, and lone surrogate code point; relative,
  scheme-relative, and non-HTTPS targets; absent or malformed authorities; any userinfo; and
  empty, non-numeric,
  signed, Unicode-digit, zero, or greater-than-65,535 explicit ports. Parser and port failures
  become the exact context-suppressed
  `ValueError("url must be an absolute credential-free HTTPS endpoint without query or fragment")`.
  Every percent sign in the authority is rejected, covering encoded host characters, ports,
  userinfo delimiters, slashes, backslashes, and controls, as well as malformed escapes and IPv6
  zones, before urllib can reinterpret the authority. NFKC inspection of the authority
  additionally rejects compatibility characters that IDNA could emit as a percent sign,
  backslash, whitespace, C0, or DEL; the accepted URL is never reconstructed or normalized. A
  117-target invalid corpus
  proves the query remains untouched and `urlencode`, `Request`, the private opener, DNS, network,
  and filesystem handlers receive no work. A 63-target raw subset fails before `urlsplit`; focused
  parser tests prove failure context suppression; five invalid timeout cases retain their earlier
  precedence; and 18 valid targets preserve their exact text, sorted query, GET, `Accept`,
  `User-Agent`, timeout identity, one bounded response read, and one acquisition. This is a
  structural boundary, not a hostname, DNS, IP-routability, or SSRF guarantee: localhost, IPv4,
  IPv6, parser-accepted IPvFuture and DNS-label forms, Unicode and trailing-dot hostnames, and
  explicit ports 1 through 65,535 remain accepted. TASK-050 governs the remaining target-port
  policy. Proxy/TLS defaults, endpoints, TASK-043 through TASK-048 response and redirect mappings,
  provider behavior, parsing, quality, storage, schemas, dependencies, runtime wiring, TASK-037
  authority, migration, and Stage 3 remain unchanged.

### TASK-048 — Fail-closed public-HTTP automatic redirect rejection

- **Key:** `phase2.fail_closed_public_http_automatic_redirect_rejection`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Files:** `src/wealth/adapters/http.py`, `tests/unit/test_http_adapter.py`,
  `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, and the coordinated governance files and governance tests.
- **Result:** The shared public transport now uses one private urllib opener whose no-follow
  handler rejects original 301, 302, 303, 307, and 308 responses before parsing `Location` or
  `URI`, reading or closing the redirect body, or opening another destination. Missing, empty,
  relative, same-origin, cross-origin, HTTPS-to-HTTP downgrade, FTP, unsupported-scheme, and
  malformed targets all remain the original response. The original 3xx enters the existing
  bounded `HTTPError` materialization path; an exact-limit body returns its original status,
  headers, and exact bytes, while a one-byte-oversize body raises
  `HttpTransportError("public HTTP error response exceeded the configured limit")` without
  truncated evidence. A deterministic five-status-by-fifteen-target real-opener matrix proves
  one original GET, one `max_response_bytes + 1` read, one cleanup attempt, no retry, no second
  read, and no follow. Additional tests preserve sanitized redirect-body read and cleanup
  mappings, direct causes, and primary-failure precedence; prove successful and non-redirect
  HTTP-error behavior, query, method, headers, timeout, proxy/TLS handler defaults; and prove in a
  fresh process that the process-global urllib opener is neither installed nor mutated. Response
  limits, endpoints, TASK-043 through TASK-047 mappings and exclusions, provider behavior,
  parsing, quality, storage, schemas, dependencies, runtime wiring, TASK-037 authority, migration,
  and Stage 3 remain unchanged. Initial request-target validation remains incomplete: the shared
  client does not yet parse and constrain its caller-supplied initial URL before request
  construction, and its private standard-library opener retains non-HTTPS scheme handlers;
  TASK-049 governs that residual risk.

### TASK-047 — Typed public-HTTP response-protocol failure mapping

- **Key:** `phase2.typed_public_http_response_protocol_failure_mapping`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Files:** `src/wealth/adapters/http.py`, `tests/unit/test_http_adapter.py`,
  `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, and the coordinated governance files and governance tests.
- **Result:** The shared public transport now converts each real `BadStatusLine`, `LineTooLong`,
  and `UnknownProtocol` raised directly by `urlopen`, a successful-response body read, or an
  `HTTPError` body read into the exact sanitized
  `HttpTransportError("public HTTP GET failed")`, with the original exception as direct cause. A
  deterministic three-exception-by-three-seam matrix proves one acquisition, one configured
  sentinel read on each body path, one cleanup attempt on the HTTP-error path, no retry or partial
  response, and no provider protocol detail in the public message. Adjacent-boundary tests prove
  direct base `HTTPException` and `InvalidURL` remain raw at all three seams, the three mapped
  protocol failures remain raw when raised by response entry or exit, and the same failures remain
  raw when raised only by HTTP-error cleanup. TASK-043 through TASK-046 mappings, TASK-045 cleanup
  and primary-failure precedence, response limits, timeouts, endpoints, queries, headers, provider
  behavior, parsing, quality, storage, schemas, dependencies, runtime wiring, operator authority,
  migration, and Stage 3 remain unchanged. Default redirects remain enabled: urllib may still
  drain a redirect body outside the adapter cap and contact a changed destination before returning
  a handle; TASK-048 governs that residual risk.

### TASK-046 — Typed pre-response public-HTTP incomplete-read mapping

- **Key:** `phase2.typed_public_http_pre_response_incomplete_read_failure_mapping`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Files:** `src/wealth/adapters/http.py`, `tests/unit/test_http_adapter.py`,
  `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, and the coordinated governance files and governance tests.
- **Result:** A real `IncompleteRead` raised directly by `urlopen` now becomes the exact sanitized
  `HttpTransportError("public HTTP GET failed")`, with the original exception as direct cause.
  Deterministic tests prove one acquisition call, no response handle or adapter body read, no
  retry, and absence of partial provider bytes and the expected-byte count from the public
  message. Adjacent-boundary tests prove `IncompleteRead` from response entry or exit and a direct
  base `HTTPException` remain raw, preventing a broad protocol catch. Existing body-read mappings,
  HTTP-error cleanup, response limits, timeouts, endpoints, queries, headers, retries, provider
  behavior, parsing, quality, storage, schemas, dependencies, runtime wiring, operator authority,
  migration, and Stage 3 remain unchanged. This task sanitizes only the resulting failure: default
  redirects remain enabled, the standard library may read a redirect body outside the adapter's
  response cap and follow a changed destination before returning a handle, and a separate
  governed redirect-policy task is still required.

### TASK-045 — Deterministic public-HTTP error-response resource closure

- **Key:** `phase2.deterministic_public_http_error_response_resource_closure`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Files:** `src/wealth/adapters/http.py`, `tests/unit/test_http_adapter.py`,
  `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, and the coordinated governance files and governance tests.
- **Result:** Every `HTTPError` processing path now makes one explicit cleanup attempt after no
  more than one `cap + 1` body read. A real built-in `HTTPError` smoke test and a counting
  `HTTPError` subclass prove exact-limit return, oversize failure, every supported read failure,
  later header failure, and close failure each invoke `close` exactly once; successful cleanup
  closes the underlying body before return or propagation. An `OSError`-family or `IncompleteRead`
  close-only failure becomes `HttpTransportError("public HTTP GET failed")` with that close error
  as direct cause; unsupported close-only failures remain unchanged. If any primary read,
  oversize, header, or processing failure already exists, no cleanup failure can replace its type,
  public message, or direct cause. Existing status, headers, body, read count, response limits,
  timeouts, endpoints, queries, retries, successful-response context management, provider
  behavior, parsing, quality, storage, schemas, dependencies, runtime wiring, operator authority,
  migration, and Stage 3 remain unchanged. A failed cleanup attempt is not claimed to have closed
  its resource.

### TASK-044 — Typed public-HTTP incomplete-body read-failure mapping

- **Key:** `phase2.typed_public_http_incomplete_body_read_failure_mapping`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Files:** `src/wealth/adapters/http.py`, `tests/unit/test_http_adapter.py`,
  `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, and the coordinated governance files and governance tests.
- **Result:** A real `http.client.IncompleteRead` raised by either the successful-response body
  read or the `HTTPError` body read now becomes the exact sanitized
  `HttpTransportError("public HTTP GET failed")`, with the original exception as direct cause.
  Deterministic path-symmetric tests prove one `cap + 1` read and one `urlopen` call, no retry or
  partial response, and absence of partial provider bytes and the expected-byte count from the
  public message. The successful-path handler is scoped only around `response.read`; a separate
  regression test proves an `IncompleteRead` raised during response-context entry remains
  unmapped. Existing
  TASK-043 mappings, exact-limit and oversize behavior, response limits, timeouts, endpoints,
  queries, headers, retries, resource closure, provider behavior, parsing, quality, storage,
  schemas, dependencies, runtime wiring, operator authority, migration, and Stage 3 remain
  unchanged.

### TASK-043 — Typed public-HTTP error-body read-failure mapping

- **Key:** `phase2.typed_public_http_error_response_read_failure_mapping`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Files:** `src/wealth/adapters/http.py`, `tests/unit/test_http_adapter.py`,
  `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, and the coordinated governance files and governance tests.
- **Result:** The shared transport now converts `URLError`, `TimeoutError`, and `OSError` raised
  while reading an `HTTPError` body into the exact sanitized
  `HttpTransportError("public HTTP GET failed")`, with the read failure as the direct cause.
  Deterministic tests prove one `cap + 1` body read and one `urlopen` call, absence of untrusted
  detail from the public message, and no retry or partial response. A symmetric successful-body
  `OSError` regression test preserves the existing mapping, while the exact-limit and
  one-byte-oversize success and HTTP-error paths remain covered. `IncompleteRead`, which is not an
  `OSError`, remains outside this task and is the separately bounded next action. Response limits,
  timeouts, endpoints, queries, headers, retries, provider behavior, resource closure, parsing,
  quality, storage, schemas, dependencies, runtime wiring, operator authority, migration, and
  Stage 3 remain unchanged.

### TASK-042 — Strict bounded public-HTTP response-byte-limit validation

- **Key:** `phase2.strict_public_http_response_byte_limit_validation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Files:** `src/wealth/adapters/http.py`, `tests/unit/test_http_adapter.py`,
  `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, and the coordinated governance files and governance tests.
- **Result:** The shared public HTTP client now accepts only a built-in integer response limit from
  1 through the current/default hard ceiling of 2,000,000 bytes. Booleans, integer subclasses,
  integral and fractional floats, `NaN`, infinities, non-positive values, and larger integers fail
  during construction with one exact error. Deterministic tests preserve minimum, representative,
  default, and maximum valid limits and prove both successful and real `HTTPError` paths read
  `cap + 1`, accept an exact-limit body, and reject a one-byte-oversize body without returning
  truncation as evidence. This is a body-byte cap, not a total wall-clock or all-metadata memory
  bound. Provider constructors, timeouts, endpoints, queries, headers, retries, response content,
  parsing, canonical evidence, quality, storage, schemas, dependencies, runtime wiring, operator
  authority, migration, and Stage 3 remain unchanged.

### TASK-041 — Finite public HTTP timeout-boundary validation

- **Key:** `phase2.finite_public_http_timeout_boundary_validation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Files:** `src/wealth/adapters/http.py`, `src/wealth/adapters/binance.py`,
  `src/wealth/adapters/coinbase.py`, `src/wealth/adapters/binance_order_flow.py`,
  `tests/unit/test_http_adapter.py`, the three public-provider unit-test files,
  `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, and the coordinated governance files and governance tests.
- **Result:** The shared public transport and all three active provider constructors now reject
  `NaN`, positive and negative infinity, zero, and negative timeouts with one exact error before
  request construction or provider HTTP work. A deterministic four-boundary matrix proves invalid
  values never reach `Request`, `urlopen`, or an injected HTTP client, while literal integer and
  fractional positive values are forwarded unchanged. The contract preserves standard urllib
  timeout semantics and does not claim a total wall-clock deadline. Endpoints, queries, headers,
  retry, pagination, range, budgets, parsing, canonical evidence, quality, storage, schemas,
  dependencies, runtime wiring, operator authority, migration, and Stage 3 remain unchanged.

### TASK-040 — Exact order-flow persistence-evidence validation

- **Key:** `phase2.exact_order_flow_persistence_evidence_validation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Files:** `src/wealth/application/order_flow_ingestion.py`,
  `src/wealth/ports/order_flow.py`, `tests/unit/test_order_flow_persistence_evidence.py`,
  `tests/integration/test_recoverable_public_trade_collection.py`,
  `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, and the coordinated governance files and governance tests.
- **Result:** Order-flow admission now requires a passing quality report, an exact coherent raw
  identity, and one ordered status-coherent outcome per canonical batch record, each bound to the
  corresponding incoming ID and record family. Missing, extra, duplicated, reordered,
  misidentified, wrong-family, contradictory, and conflicting evidence fails closed.
  Deterministic hostile-store tests cover the complete matrix while preserving valid zero-record
  windows, and recoverable public-trade collection proves malformed returned evidence leaves its
  durable cursor and completion counters unchanged and prevents a later request even when the
  nonconforming store physically wrote the first window. Returned-outcome validation does not
  independently prove physical durability, undo store mutations, or make the evidence and control
  databases atomic. Provider, network, retry, range, quality, canonical models, raw bytes, store
  implementations, schemas, dependencies, operator authority, migration, and Stage 3 remain
  unchanged.

### TASK-039 — Exact candle persistence-evidence validation

- **Key:** `phase2.exact_candle_persistence_evidence_validation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Files:** `src/wealth/application/ingestion.py`, `src/wealth/ports/market.py`,
  `tests/unit/test_historical_candle_persistence_evidence.py`,
  `tests/integration/test_recoverable_collection.py`, `docs/contracts/MARKET_DATA.md`, and the
  coordinated governance files and governance tests.
- **Result:** Historical candle admission now requires a passing quality report, an exact coherent
  raw-write identity, and one ordered status-coherent write outcome per batch candle, each
  matching its corresponding incoming ID. Missing, extra, duplicated, reordered, misattributed,
  contradictory, and conflicting outcomes fail closed. Deterministic hostile-store tests cover
  the full evidence matrix, and a recoverable collection test proves that incomplete returned
  evidence leaves the durable cursor and completion counters unchanged and prevents a later page
  even when the nonconforming store physically wrote the first page. The contract documentation
  states that returned-outcome validation does not independently prove physical durability, undo
  store mutations, or make the market and checkpoint databases atomic. Provider, retry,
  pagination, quality, canonical records, raw bytes, digests, lineage, store implementations,
  SQLite schemas and transactions, dependencies, order-flow ingestion, operator authority,
  migration, and Stage 3 remain unchanged.

### TASK-038 — Public-provider payload failure-boundary hardening

- **Key:** `phase2.public_provider_payload_failure_boundary_hardening`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** Binance candles, Coinbase candles, and Binance aggregate trades now convert invalid
  UTF-8, malformed JSON, excessive nesting, and decoder `ValueError` failures into each
  provider's sanitized, non-retryable typed `INVALID_PAYLOAD` error. Deterministic no-network
  tests pin every decoder cause, exact public detail, preserved cause type, and aggregate-trade
  split semantics. Endpoints, queries, byte bounds, timeouts, HTTP retry behavior, valid-payload
  canonicalization, raw-byte lineage, digests, provider schemas, storage, runtime wiring,
  dependencies, operator paths, SQLite, TASK-037 authority, migration, and Stage 3 remain
  unchanged.

### TASK-036 — Synthetic operator-preflight authorization-request contract foundation

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_preflight_operator_authorization_request_contract_foundation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** One unused strict frozen proposal plan is pinned to the private exact TASK-035
  all-family bundle plan. A zero-argument pure builder emits exactly eight ordered immutable
  literal slots linked to the reviewed families plus fixed unselected snapshot-method,
  report-destination, and retention/disposal placeholders. Fixed states remain `proposal_only`,
  `none_proposal_only`, human approval `not_recorded`, operator-data access `not_authorized`, and
  the Stage 3 gate `not_satisfied`; successful construction, validation, review, or merge grants
  no authority. Deep strict validation rejects altered plans, ordinals, family/slot mappings,
  placeholders, subclasses, bypassed construction, extras, and any authority-state forgery. The
  eight symbolic slots prove synthetic family coverage only and do not assert that a future real
  deployment has one path per family; a later populated package must establish its own reviewed
  cardinality. No real path, path check, filesystem, SQLite, operator data, scan, adapter, report,
  manifest, serialization, runtime consumer, scanner, migration, schema change, or Stage 3 action
  was added.

### TASK-035 — Synthetic all-family candidate-census bundle reconciliation evidence foundation

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_preflight_timestamp_candidate_census_bundle_evidence_foundation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** One immutable pure bundle plan now pins the complete reviewed TASK-034 plan sequence
  and accepts only an exact built-in tuple of eight deeply valid family census results in
  canonical order. The result retains all eight TASK-034 inputs and their nested evidence
  unchanged while exactly reconciling eight families, 20 tables, 37 columns, total and exhaustive
  status counts, sorted source-offset and precision frequencies, and projectable epoch extrema.
  Deep validation rejects missing, duplicate, reordered, forged, subclassed, or altered sources,
  plans, counts, frequencies, and extrema before aggregation. Synthetic tests cover the exact
  one-row aggregate, all-empty families, mixed outcomes and bounds, hostile source sequences,
  deep forgery before aggregation, and post-TASK-034 no-I/O behavior. No filesystem, SQLite,
  operator scan, stored-projection comparison, row/instant/collision grouping, serialization,
  report, manifest, adapter, replacement, runtime consumer, migration, schema change, or Stage 3
  completion was added.

### TASK-034 — Synthetic canonical-candidate census evidence foundation

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_preflight_timestamp_candidate_census_evidence_foundation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** Eight immutable pure family-scoped census plans now flatten the exact TASK-033
  declarations into one ordered summary per source-family timestamp column, collectively covering
  all eight families, 20 tables, and 37 columns, including genuinely empty columns. Every summary
  exactly reconciles its total, exhaustive candidate and parse status counts, bounded sorted
  source-offset and fractional-precision frequencies, and projectable epoch extrema while
  retaining the complete TASK-033 and nested TASK-030/031/032 evidence unchanged. Deep validation
  rejects forged plans, candidates, declarations, summaries, counts, frequencies, extrema,
  registry replacement, and reordered or missing evidence. Synthetic tests cover all families,
  empty and mixed columns, malformed and nullable inputs, signed and subminute offsets, precision,
  duplicate instants, calendar overflow, epoch bounds, and post-snapshot no-I/O behavior. No
  report, operator scan, grouping, collision identity, replacement, runtime consumer, migration,
  schema change, or Stage 3 completion was added.

### TASK-033 — Synthetic canonical-instant candidate evidence foundation

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_preflight_timestamp_canonical_candidate_evidence_foundation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** One immutable pure registry now wraps the exact eight TASK-032 plans and freezes the
  complete two-success/eight-nonprojectable status partition. Every ordered parse outcome retains
  its source evidence and receives either an exact built-in `datetime.UTC`, exact 27-character
  six-fractional-digit `Z` text, and exact epoch-microsecond triple; a typed year-boundary
  normalization overflow; or a source-not-projectable disposition. Epoch and text candidates
  round-trip through the TASK-028/029 primitives. Tests cover all eight families and 37 columns,
  positive, negative, and subminute offsets, exact calendar and epoch bounds, equal instants with
  distinct spellings retained separately, every prior failure status, forged nested evidence,
  registry replacement, ordering, and post-snapshot no-I/O behavior. No collision grouping,
  report, operator scan, replacement byte, runtime consumer, migration, or Stage 3 completion was
  added.

### TASK-032 — Synthetic SQLite timestamp parse-evidence foundation

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_preflight_timestamp_parse_evidence_foundation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** One immutable pure registry now binds the exact TASK-031 plans for all eight store
  families to 20 offset-preserving Python `isoformat` text columns, 15 fixed-UTC `isoformat` text
  columns, two signed epoch-microsecond integer columns, and the exact five nullable declarations.
  Manual component parsing plus exact writer round trips preserve offset spelling and subsecond
  offsets without normalization. Every source cell receives one typed outcome for aware text,
  fixed-UTC policy mismatch, naive text, declared absence, malformed UTF-8/text/epoch bytes,
  calendar-range overflow, or unexpected SQLite storage. Deep validation rejects forged plans,
  snapshots, rows, keys, cells, outcomes, and public-registry replacement before parsing.
  Synthetic end-to-end tests cover all 37 columns and hostile TEXT, NULL, INTEGER, REAL, and BLOB
  evidence while retaining exact bytes, row order, TASK-030 fingerprint, TASK-031 plan, and
  snapshot identity. The module performs no I/O, has no runtime consumer, scans no operator data,
  emits no replacement bytes, and does not complete Stage 3.

### TASK-031 — Synthetic SQLite timestamp-byte evidence foundation

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_preflight_timestamp_evidence_foundation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** One pinned strict extraction plan per TASK-030 family now declares all 20 direct
  timestamp-bearing tables and 37 timestamp columns. The unused generated-fixture-only inspector
  fingerprints and extracts through the same immutable connection and exact whole-file snapshot,
  fails before row access unless exactly one expected family matches, and temporarily authorizes
  only each declared stable key and timestamp target. Bounded deterministic evidence preserves
  SQLite `typeof`, exact `hex(CAST(column AS BLOB))`, byte length, row-key bytes, and snapshot
  linkage without materializing a raw timestamp value. Tests cover all layouts, NULL, INTEGER,
  REAL, TEXT, BLOB, malformed text bytes, ordering, bounds, oversized cells, mismatches,
  wrong-family and ambiguity rejection, and unchanged source/directory evidence. No operator
  database, parser, report, manifest, runtime consumer, migration, or repair was added, and Stage
  3 remains incomplete.

### TASK-030 — Synthetic read-only SQLite preflight fingerprint foundation

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_preflight_fingerprint_foundation`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** Strict frozen version-1 contracts now keep the expected family identity separate
  from observed evidence. A direct `mode=ro&immutable=1` inspector fingerprints encoding,
  application and user versions, exact typed marker bytes, normalized DDL, every schema object,
  tables, columns, foreign keys, explicit and implicit indexes, and triggers for all eight
  generated SQLite layouts. Exact pinned digests reject missing, extra, renamed, altered,
  spoofed, combined, wrong-family, or ambiguous layouts before timestamp rows can be read. Source
  hash, size, modification time, file identity, directory entries, and sidecar absence are
  reverified; an authorizer denies writes, temporary objects, `ATTACH`, and write pragmas. The
  foundation remains unused, scans no operator database or timestamp row, writes no report, and
  does not complete Stage 3.

### TASK-029 — Additive exact epoch-microsecond projection primitives

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_epoch_microsecond_primitives`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** The isolated canonical-UTC module now exposes exact signed bounds plus integer-only
  projection and inverse decoding between strict fixed-`datetime.UTC` values and Unix-epoch
  microseconds. Strict type and range handling rejects booleans, non-integers, and values outside
  Python's calendar; deterministic, property-style, and hostile-subclass tests prove exact
  negative/zero/positive landmarks, full-range round trips, one-microsecond distinction, and
  monotonic order. No runtime consumer, model, serialized byte, digest, identity, schema, query,
  projection, migration, or stored record changed.

### TASK-028 — Additive canonical UTC codec primitives

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_codec_primitives`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** One isolated pure module now provides strict fixed-`datetime.UTC` validation,
  explicit aware-input normalization, exact six-fractional-digit RFC 3339 `Z` serialization, and a
  strict canonical parser. Exhaustive deterministic and property-style tests cover offsets,
  named/rule-based zones, folds, calendar limits, malformed text, exact round trips, and hostile
  datetime subclasses. No existing runtime path imports or calls the helpers, and no model,
  serializer, digest, identity, schema, projection, query, or stored record changed.

### TASK-027 — Canonical UTC clock-boundary enforcement

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_clock_boundary_enforcement`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Result:** One shared exact-`datetime.UTC` assertion now guards every direct injected-clock
  read in the scoped foundation, application, rate-budget, provider, and public-trade boundaries.
  Invalid initial values fail before IDs or downstream mutations; invalid later reads fail before
  the next side effect; provider and application error mappings remain typed. Persisted models,
  request acceptance, JSON, digests, keys, schemas, projections, and stored data are unchanged.

### TASK-026 — Canonical UTC boundary inventory and migration plan

- **Key:** `phase2.canonical_utc_boundary_inventory_and_migration_plan`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Decision:** `docs/decisions/0027-canonical-utc-boundary-and-migration-plan.md`
- **Result:** The repository now has an evidence-backed inventory of every discovered
  timestamp-bearing model, clock, provider edge, JSON/text boundary, SQLite projection, order,
  index, cursor, and test path. It selects Python datetimes in the fixed `datetime.UTC` zone, fixed
  microsecond-precision RFC 3339 `Z` text, and derived epoch-microsecond SQL projections as the
  target, with staged compatibility readers, preflight, quarantine, collision handling, digest
  versioning, backup, rollback, and migration verification. No runtime, schema, or data migration
  was performed.
- **Inventory:** `docs/CANONICAL_UTC_BOUNDARY_INVENTORY_AND_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

### TASK-025 — Typed public-trade transition-history reader

- **Key:** `phase2.public_trade_transition_history_reader`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Decision:** `docs/decisions/0026-typed-public-trade-transition-history.md`
- **Result:** The existing append-only SQLite transition ledger is now exposed through an
  immutable typed record and a read-only port with ascending contiguous checkpoint-version pages,
  an exclusive cursor, actor-authority and lifecycle validation, strict bounds, restart behavior,
  and fail-closed projection, canonical-record, continuity, and corruption checks. The existing
  schema is unchanged.

### TASK-024 — Public-trade checkpoint orchestrator

- **Key:** `phase2.public_trade_checkpoint_orchestrator`
- **Risk tier:** RISK 1 — DEVELOPMENT
- **Status:** COMPLETE
- **Decision:** `docs/decisions/0025-bounded-public-trade-checkpoint-orchestration.md`
- **Result:** One explicitly invoked bounded application flow now composes the public-trade range
  collector, durable request budget, market-evidence admission, and restart-safe checkpoint
  control with policy validation, UUID fencing, evidence-first progress, typed outcomes, and
  injected UTC time.

## Queued, Not Yet Approved

- Design continuous public-trade collection only after typed transition audit access and
  operational recovery drills are accepted.

## Backlog Rules

- Only one item may be the canonical next action.
- A task must define goal, scope, constraints, acceptance evidence, and excluded work before code.
- Missing approval, policy, state, or critical evidence fails closed.
- Completing a task does not authorize deployment, mode promotion, private access, or trading.
